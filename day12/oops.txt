Types of Relationships in Java

1. HAS-A Relationship
2. IS-A Relationship


HAS-A Relationship
------------------
Represents object ownership or association.

a) Aggregation
   → Weak HAS-A relationship.
   → Child object is created outside the parent class.
   → Child object can exist independently of the parent.

b) Composition
   → Strong HAS-A relationship.
   → Parent class creates and owns the child object.
   → Child object cannot exist independently.


IS-A Relationship
-----------------
Represents inheritance using the `extends` keyword.


Rules of super Calling Statement
--------------------------------
1. `super()` is a constructor calling statement.
   It is used to call the constructor of the superclass.

2. `super()` must be the first statement inside a constructor.

3. If the programmer does not write `super()`,
   the compiler automatically inserts a no-argument `super()` call.

4. `this()` and `super()` cannot be used together
   inside the same constructor.

5. Only one `super()` call is allowed in a constructor.



Q1. super vs this calling statement

Types of Inheritance:

1. Single-level Inheritance
   → One class inherits from only one superclass.

2. Multi-level Inheritance (not acheivable in java with help of class becs of daimond problem)
   → A class inherits from another class,
     which itself inherits from another superclass
     (inheritance at different levels).

3. Hierarchical Inheritance
   → One superclass is inherited by
     multiple subclasses at the same level.

4. Hybrid Inheritance
    → Conbination of any two
