Typecasting:
    conversion of one dataype to another

    Types:
        1. primitive Typecasting        [primitive <=> primitive]
        2. non primitive Typecasting    [non primitive <=> non primitive]

    1. primitive:
        widening => smaller to bigger datatypes
        narrowing => bigger to smaller datatypes
        flow :
            byte -> short -> int -> long(8) -> float(4) -> double
            char -> int -> long(8) -> float(4) -> double

    2. Non primitive
        upcasting => subclass to superclass
        downcasting => superclass tp subclass
