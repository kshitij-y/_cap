Encapsulation:
    the binding or wrapping the state and behaviors of an object is called as Encapsulation

    state -> variables
    behaviors -> methods

    why? : to achieve data hinding.
    data hiding: the process of hiding direct access by providing controlled access

    How to avoid direct access?
        using private access modifier / specifier
        private is a keyword
        if we make any member as private we can not use that variable directly in diff class.

    How to provide controlled access?
        using getter and setter

        getter -> used to get or retrive private variable;
        setter -> used to set or modify private variable
